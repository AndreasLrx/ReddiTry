<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![The app](https://github.com/EpitechMscProPromo2025/T-DEV-600-NAN-6-1-redditech-clement.chaban/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/profie_screen.png)

Before starting the app, we have created a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/K4gPy3BvqKo7p3aJsLFL15/ReddiTRY?node-id=0%3A1&t=NvnjkBEVABEMaAPs-1ZQ) to have a global idea of the app.

This is the fifth Epitech project in the Pre-MSc cursus. This project aims at creating a Reddit client.

We had some constraints:

- Use the Reddit API
- Provide a profile page
- Connect to Reddit with OAuth
- Show post of the subreddit the user is sub
- Filter those post by 3 diff√©rents way
- Show subreddit the user is sub
- Provide a way for subscribe and unsubscribe from an subreddit
- Add a good pagination
- The post can contained videos, images and text
- Implement test and documentation

In addition to those constraints, we aim to add some BONUSES:

- Continuous integration
- Tutoriel for use the app
